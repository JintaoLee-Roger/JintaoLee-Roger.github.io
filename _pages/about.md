I received the B.S. degree in geophysics from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn/), Hefei, China, in 2020, where I am pursuing the PhD degree with [Computational Interpretation Group (CIG)](http://cig.ustc.edu.cn/) and advised by Prof. [Xinming Wu](http://ess.ustc.edu.cn/faculties/detail-213.html).

**Research:** I’m currently focused on applying AI in geophysics. Specifically, I’m working on high-resolution processing of seismic data to improve thin layer detection, implicit structural modeling, clustering, and adapting large language models and large vision models to the field of geophysics.
